# Numerical Methods for Option Pricing

The repository contains C++ code for option pricing using several versions of finite-difference methods, namely explicit finite-difference method, implicit finite-difference method (LU decomposition and SOR) and the Crank-Nicolson method. The code follows closely with the pseudo-code provided in Paul Willmott's book 'The Mathematics of Financial Derivatives'.
